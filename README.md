# SnakeEvolution
Short test to implement neuroevolution in java, used to optimize an AI in the snake game. Compile and run noGraphics for fastest runtime, run showGeneration and input specified generation name to get graphical look at that generation. graphics.java is basically useless.

Yeah, just do what it says in the description:
  noGraphics.java has fastest runtime
  graphics.java is slow but visualizes every member of each population as it evolves
  showGeneration.java is used to visualize generations

Note that there may be a bug concerning the filePath variable in those three files, just edit it to wherever you want to save generations.
